Hi 
I decided to use pandas for getting and processing this information.   (about half way thru, I should have used Jason formats and a SQL database instead).  (I will take a look of doing that today and hopefully can get something together by the end of tomorrow, since I know what needs to be done.)

I stated this project reading the exact input_sample in python and tried several ways and couldn’t  figure out how to put the input into  a list, so I ended up putting the data  in a text file and renamed it to be: fd.py.  That way I could just import fd.py and use the various inputs as lists as  I needed.
I will place fd.py in both input and the src directories.

The name of my source program is MyProject.py
Two variables can be changed:  
debug  (default is False,  if changed to True, will list out debugging and tracing information
path (default is ‘’,  will be prefixed to location of ‘df_ingest_pandas.csv’ (be care of word’s quote, if you copy and paste from here)

I ran into two problems both with trying to run: UPDATES
I’m getting the following screen image when trying to update SITE_VISITS and ORDERS (I’ve haven’t been able to figure it out yet and may look later today)  

 

Since I ran into the above problems, I have deferred trying to do NEW Orders by themselves since I’m sure I would eventually encounter the same error

I ran and debug my program using Jupyter Notebooks.
I put a few comments scattered in the program and hope they are enough to basically see and understand what I did.  I created a single panda for retaining all of the information.  It was a real pain, so I might enjoy trying a different way.
If you have any questions, please email me or set up a conference call and we can discuss them.

Thank You,
